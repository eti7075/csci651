It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a long-running dark comedy TV series that revolves around the lives of five incredibly narcissistic, unethical, and morally bankrupt friends who own and operate Paddy's Pub, a rundown Irish bar in South Philadelphia. The group—Mac (Rob McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito)—are known as "The Gang" and are infamous for their selfish, impulsive, and often sociopathic behavior. Each episode typically follows The Gang as they engage in ridiculous schemes, get-rich-quick scams, elaborate pranks, and petty feuds, all of which inevitably backfire due to their collective incompetence, delusions, and general disregard for human decency.

Mac, the self-proclaimed “muscle” of the group, is deeply insecure, obsessed with his own masculinity, and frequently deluded about his abilities. Charlie, the illiterate and childlike janitor of the bar, is often manipulated by the others and harbors an unhealthy obsession with "The Waitress." Dennis, a self-absorbed sociopath, believes himself to be an irresistible genius, while his twin sister Dee is desperate for success but constantly ridiculed by the group. Frank, the depraved and reckless father figure, funds many of their absurd adventures while fully embracing his own degeneracy.

The show is known for pushing boundaries, satirizing controversial topics such as politics, race, gender, and ethics in an exaggerated, unapologetic manner. Unlike traditional sitcoms, there are no redeeming arcs or lessons; The Gang never grows or learns from their mistakes, creating an endlessly chaotic and hilarious dynamic. Over the years, It's Always Sunny has gained a cult following due to its fearless humor, absurd scenarios, and the cast’s impeccable comedic chemistry. It remains one of the longest-running live-action sitcoms in TV history, continually reinventing itself while staying true to its outrageous, irreverent roots.
