Requirements: 
- The IP address space is 20.10.172.0â€”20.10.172.255.
- LAN A has at least 50 hosts
- LAN B has at least 75 hosts
- LAN C has at least 20 hosts

Specify:
- Subnet Mask
- Network Address
- Smallest IP address
- Highest IP address

Going from largest requirement to smallest, we see B needs 75 hosts, A needs 50 and C needs 20.
B requires 75 hosts, so it needs 7 bits for all its addresses: 2^6 < 75 < 2^7.
Therefore, we know the subnet mask is the first 25 bits, since 32 - 7 = 25.
We will give LAN B the addresses from 0-127 to fufill its needs.
Next, A requires 50 hosts, which means it needs 6 bits for all its addresses: 2^5 < 50 < 2^6.
Therefore, we know the subnet mask is the first 26 bits, since 32 - 6 = 26.
We will give LAN A the addresses from 128 - 191.
Finally for C, we see that it only needs 20 hosts, so 5 bits: 2^4 < 20 < 2^5.
Therefore we know the subnet mask is the first 27 bits, since 32 - 5 = 27.
We will give C the addresses from 192 to 223.

Note: broadcast address is required for each subnet at the highest point before the next subnet. 

This leaves us with the following details for each subnet:
LAN A:
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192/26
Network Address: 20.10.172.128
Smallest IP Available: 20.10.172.129
Largest IP Available: 20.10.172.190

LAN B:
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128/25
Network Address: 20.10.172.0
Smallest IP Available: 20.10.172.1
Largest IP Available: 20.10.172.126

LAN C:
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.224/27
Network Address: 20.10.172.192
Smallest IP Available: 20.10.172.193
Largest IP Available: 20.10.172.222
